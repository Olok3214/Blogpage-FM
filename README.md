### What I learned

To center a flexbox horizontally and vertically you have to set
100% heitght to html,body

html,body{
    height: 100%;
}
body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

And, if you have only one element in a flexbox, you can use 
margin to center it vertically
